📁 Project: ALP College Exam – Algorithm & Game Project (2023)

🧠 Description:
This project was submitted for our college algorithm course exam in 2023. It was a collaborative assignment, but I took the initiative to implement most of the logic using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) — even though OOP hadn’t been formally introduced in class yet.

🎮 Project Highlights:
- Developed ~80% of the game's logic and structure
- Implemented OOP concepts (classes, objects, encapsulation) to organize the code for better readability and scalability
- Integrated basic gameplay mechanics and flow
- Partner contributed standard logic and basic structures

⚙️ Language & Tools:
- [Insert Language, e.g., C++ or Java]
- Console-based interaction
- Compiled and tested on [insert IDE/environment]

💡 What I Learned:
- Self-taught the fundamentals of OOP to improve project structure
- Learned to break down game logic into modular components
- Practiced team collaboration and version control (managing responsibilities between members)

📌 Note:
This was my first real project involving game logic and partial self-learning beyond the syllabus.

📁 Files:
- `main.cpp` — Game entry point and logic
- `Player.cpp`, `Enemy.cpp`, etc. — OOP class structure
